username=victim
Username is always escaped of special characters, password is hashed.
Seems like we need to reverse our solution as a hash.

Looks like there is a flaw in the md5 hash.  It outputs it's hash as binary.
Because of this we can get special characters in our string.

username=victim
password=?
binary_md5_hash(password)='OR 1=1#'1111111
We need to shorten this hash if we want to brute force it.
binary_md5_hash(password)='||1#.............
